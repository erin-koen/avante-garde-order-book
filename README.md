## Thought Process
```
Redux - managing a 100 item orderbook (coinbase pro aggregates to 50 most pertinent bids and offers) isn't hugely complicated for a single component, but for extensibility's sake, Redux makes sense. In the example photo, the order book is displayed graphically and in chart form. Redux simplifies access to the state generated by a single API call, rather than having to manage state flowing through to those disparate components.
