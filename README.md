## Thought Process
```
Redux - managing a 100 item orderbook (50 orders on each side of the mid seems like it's reasonably useful) isn't hugely complicated for a single component, but for extensibility's sake, Redux makes sense. In the example photo, the order book is displayed graphically and in chart form. Redux simplifies access to the state generated by a single API call, rather than having to manage state flowing through to those disparate components. 

App component architecture - 
- App = will call the action on component did mount and map state to props
    - separate components for bids and asks. THey come back from the API separately and sorted as they need to be.
